## Usage

- `set DATAVERSE_password=<password>` to set an environment variable with the account password used to access dataverse
    - The other config settings can also be set through environment variables prefixed with "DATAVERSE_", e.g. `DATAVERSE_tenant_id`. 

```python
config = DataverseConfig() # instantiating config reads from env vars
client = DataverseRestClient(config)

entry = client.get_entry(table, entry_id)
```

## REST API and Queries

URLs are formatted like `https://<ORG_ID>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/<TABLE><QUERY>`

To fetch an entity by its primary key: `https://<ORG_ID>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/<TABLE>({entry_primary_id})`
To fetch an entity by an alternate key: `https://<ORG_ID>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/<TABLE>({alt_key_name}={entry_primary_id})`
    - Note: string values must include single quotes: e.g. `(mouse_id='123456')`

To filter and query: 
- [odata query docs](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata03/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata03-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#_The_$filter_System)
- `https://<ORG_ID>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/<TABLE>?$filter=contains(crb81_mouse_id, 614)`
- `https://<ORG_ID>.crm.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/<TABLE>?$filter=crb81_sex eq 0`

## Dataverse setup

In order to write to table
Set up security role at admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com - Environment - Settings -Security Roles
Assign the role to svc_sipe account

Important:
Primary Column is NOT actual primary key - that's the autogenerated guid column `<tablename>_baseid`
Had to add Alternate Key (make.powerapps - table - Schema - Keys)
  Alternate key must be unique - will fail if duplicate values are found

For instance, the dim_mice table has a dim_mice_baseid column with uids, but we'd like to refer to mice by their 6-7 digit mouse_id. This table should be given an Alternate Key for the mouse_id column, so you can refer to a mouse with `(mouse_id='614173')`

## Repo setup
 - To use this template, click the green `Use this template` button and `Create new repository`.
 - After github initially creates the new repository, please wait an extra minute for the initialization scripts to finish organizing the repo.
 - To enable the automatic semantic version increments: in the repository go to `Settings` and `Collaborators and teams`. Click the green `Add people` button. Add `svc-aindscicomp` as an admin. Modify the file in `.github/workflows/tag_and_publish.yml` and remove the if statement in line 65. The semantic version will now be incremented every time a code is committed into the main branch.
 - To publish to PyPI, enable semantic versioning and uncomment the publish block in `.github/workflows/tag_and_publish.yml`. The code will now be published to PyPI every time the code is committed into the main branch.
 - The `.github/workflows/test_and_lint.yml` file will run automated tests and style checks every time a Pull Request is opened. If the checks are undesired, the `test_and_lint.yml` can be deleted. The strictness of the code coverage level, etc., can be modified by altering the configurations in the `pyproject.toml` file and the `.flake8` file.
 - Please make any necessary updates to the README.md and CITATION.cff files
